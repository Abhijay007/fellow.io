### Abstract :

We are making a Platform for students named fellow(dot)io, This platform is a one-stop solution for the all the college students to find different open opportunities around various mentorship, fellowships , internships and boot camps etc, on a single platform by filtering according to their tech, interest and program type specification, student often missed out opportunities during their college life due to lack of knowledge and awareness about the different opening, the motive behind building this platform is to make them aware about these opportunities on time, as we are making a mailing list too so that when a particular program start accepting applications student will get notification and apply accordingly on time, we are also thinking about adding some exclusive features on this platform like mentors profile so that student will get right mentorship according to the programs, we will also add experiences section where student can also read otherâ€™s past experiences with the program. We will make it interactive and give students the option to add openings, once students add an opening we will review that and make sure that opportunity is worth applying to or not, and if it is we will add it to the platform, using this platform students will get an idea about the application process of the particular program and also about the timeline and requirements of the program. We will also be thinking about running podcasts around it and in that podcast, we will talk to past mentees and students associated with that particular program.

### Introduction:

The higher education landscape is constantly evolving, and with it, opportunities are available to students. While traditional paths such as internships and job placements remain popular, newer options such as mentorship programs, fellowships, and boot camps are gaining traction as well. These opportunities can provide valuable experiences and skills that can help students stand out in the job market, but they can be difficult to find and access. That's where fellow(dot)io comes in.

fellow(dot)io is a platform designed to connect college students with open opportunities in various fields. Our goal is to provide a one-stop solution for students to find and apply to mentorship, fellowship, internship, and boot camp programs that align with their interests and career goals. We believe that by bringing all of these opportunities together on a single platform, we can help students make the most of their college years and set themselves up for success after graduation.

**Problem**:

One of the main challenges that college students face is the lack of knowledge and awareness about the various open opportunities that exist. This can lead to missed opportunities, particularly for students who are not proactive in seeking out these types of programs. In addition, the application process for many of these opportunities can be time-consuming and confusing, making it difficult for students to know where to start.

**Solution**:

fellow(dot)io aims to solve these problems by providing a central platform where students can find and apply to a wide range of open opportunities. The platform will include a mailing list feature that will allow students to receive notifications when particular programs begin accepting applications, ensuring that they don't miss out on any opportunities. In addition, the platform will feature a mentor profile section, which will allow students to find mentors who are well-suited to their interests and career goals.

**Motivation**:

One of the main reasons for building fellow(dot)io is to help college students overcome the common challenge of missing out on valuable opportunities due to a lack of knowledge and awareness about the different openings available. Many students are unaware of the various programs and opportunities that exist, and as a result, they miss out on opportunities that could help them grow and develop their skills. fellow(dot)io aims to address this problem by providing students with a comprehensive and easily accessible platform where they can discover and explore a wide range of opportunities.

### *Features*:

- **Opportunity Filtering**: fellow(dot)io allows students to filter opportunities by tech, interest, and program type to find the ones that best fit their needs. This helps students avoid the time-consuming process of sifting through unrelated or irrelevant opportunities.
- **Mailing List**: We understand that students can be busy and that it can be easy to miss out on opportunities if you're not looking for them. That's why we offer a mailing list feature that sends notifications to students when programs start accepting applications. This helps students stay up to date and apply on time.
- **Mentors Profiles**: One of the key benefits of mentorship programs is the opportunity to learn from experienced professionals in your field. fellow(dot)io offers profiles of mentors, so students can get a sense of who they will be working with and whether they would be a good fit.
- **Experiences Section**: In addition to profiles, we also have an experiences section where students can read about the experiences of past mentees and students who have participated in programs. This can provide valuable insights and help students make informed decisions about which opportunities to pursue.
- **Interactive Platform**: fellow(dot)io is more than just a directory of opportunities. We also encourage students to add openings that they come across and our team reviews and approves these submissions to ensure that they are worth applying to. This helps make the platform a community-driven resource for finding opportunities.
- **Podcasts**: In addition to our platform, we also plan to offer podcasts featuring interviews with past mentees and students who have participated in programs. These podcasts will provide valuable insights and perspectives on what it's like to be a part of these opportunities.

### Vision:

fellow(dot)io is a platform designed to help college students find and apply to mentorship, fellowship, internship, and boot camp programs. By bringing all of these opportunities together on a single platform, we hope to make it easier for students to find the right fit and make the most of their college years. With features such as filtering, a mailing list, mentor profiles, an experiences section, and podcasts, we believe that fellow(dot)io can be a valuable resource for students looking to take their careers to the next level.

###  What do you currently imagine as the final output of your project? (for example, a website, a visualization, a workshop): 

My vision for fellow(dot)io is to develop it into a comprehensive web application that can be accessed from both desktop and mobile devices. The primary objective is to make this platform more accessible to students worldwide, regardless of their geographical location or financial constraints. With a web app that can be accessed on-the-go, students will have the flexibility to use it anytime and anywhere without limitations.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a platform that connects students worldwide and provides them with the necessary resources and tools to enhance their learning experience. To achieve this, the website must have a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate interface, with a comprehensive database of resources such as articles, study materials, videos, and online courses.

To introduce the web app to students and gather feedback on how to improve the platform further, I plan to conduct workshops in different institutions. These workshops will provide an opportunity for students to learn how to use the platform and suggest additional features that would make the web app more useful. The feedback from these workshops will be instrumental in enhancing the platform's functionality and user experience.

To ensure that the workshops are accessible to as many students as possible, they will be available online so that students who cannot physically attend can participate remotely. The workshops will be recorded and used as tutorials on the website so that students who have difficulty using the web app can follow along and gain a better understanding of the platform's features.

The end goal of this project is to create a fully developed web app accessible on desktop and mobile devices, with a user-friendly interface, a comprehensive database of resources, and the ability to conduct workshops both physically and online. Gathering feedback from these workshops will enable continuous improvement of the platform and provide students worldwide with an accessible and effective platform to enhance their learning experience.

### What challenges do you anticipate for your project?:

As a developer, I understand the importance of being aware of potential roadblocks that may arise during the project's development so that we can better prepare to address them. In the case of my project, fellow(dot)io, there are several challenges that I expect to encounter.

The first challenge is transitioning from a no-code platform to a code-based platform to make the project open-source. This transition requires a significant amount of time and effort to ensure that the project is accessible to developers worldwide. I will need to consider factors such as documentation, coding standards, and developer tools to make it easy for other developers to contribute to the project.

The second challenge is making the project more accessible to students. To achieve this, I will need to invest time in developing resources to help students learn more about the platform. I also plan to add login/signup functionality to allow mentors and mentees to create accounts and add their coding profiles and past experiences. This feature will enable us to help them find relevant opportunities and connect with others with similar interests. Developing this feature will require significant time and effort.

The third challenge is developing the project on my own. As a solo developer, I will need to prioritize tasks, seek out other perspectives, and maintain momentum and motivation to complete the project on time and to the best of my abilities.

I believe these are some challenges I anticipate for my project.

### Who is this project for? How does your project foster community? Be specific about the needs this community has had presently and/or historically, and how your project will address those directly.:

The project is designed specifically for students around the world who want to start their careers in any particular field related to technology or any other field. However, in the beginning, we will be focusing more on tech opportunities. My aim is to create a one-stop solution for students to find different open opportunities, including mentorship, fellowships, internships, and boot camps, among others.

The platform will enable students to filter these opportunities based on their tech skills, interests, and program-type specifications, making it easier for them to find relevant openings. The platform will be accessible to every student out there and will also support those who have not had equal access due to various reasons like race, gender, class, sexuality, immigration/documentation status, age, geographical location, and disability. I believe that everyone should have access to equal opportunities to kick-start their career.

The need for such a platform is significant as students face several challenges in finding opportunities related to their field of interest. Many students have to go through a time-consuming and tedious process of searching for relevant opportunities and then applying for them. I understand that some students may not have access to the right network or resources to find relevant opportunities, which can lead to a lack of diversity and representation in various industries.

The platform fosters community by bringing together students from different backgrounds and regions to access a range of opportunities. I recognize that certain communities have historically had less access to such opportunities, and I aim to address that by promoting diversity in my platform's filtering options. This will allow me to create a more inclusive platform that caters to the specific needs of different communities.

I aim to foster a sense of community by connecting students with mentors, peers, and professionals in their fields of interest. This will provide students with the opportunity to learn from experienced professionals, receive guidance, and network with others in their industry. I believe that this will not only help students to gain valuable skills and experience but also build a sense of community and belonging.

fellow(dot)io also addresses the issue of accessibility. I understand that some students may not have access to resources like computers or the Internet, which can make it difficult for them to access opportunities. I aim to address this issue by making my platform accessible through mobile devices and ensuring that my platform is accessible to students with disabilities.

The project aims to provide students from around the world with equal access to opportunities related to their field of interest. I foster community by promoting diversity and connecting students with mentors, peers, and professionals in their industry. I address the issue of accessibility by making my platform accessible to all students, regardless of their location or disabilities. I believe that this platform will enable students to achieve their career goals and build a better future for themselves and their communities.

### How does your project address one or more of the Priority Areas?:

The fellow(dot)io project is a platform aimed at providing opportunities accessible to all students worldwide. It has two primary focus areas: accessibility and open source, with the added touch of artificial intelligence (AI) for application assistance.

In terms of accessibility, the fellow(dot)io project is designed to cater to the needs of students from all backgrounds, regardless of their location or financial situation. The platform aims to make it easier for students to find relevant opportunities based on their interests, program-type specifications, and tech skills. This is made possible through a user-friendly interface that allows students to filter opportunities according to their needs.

The project also focuses on the priority area of open source, allowing developers to contribute to its development and learn within the community through various code and non-code ways while developing projects in an open-source ecosystem. The platform encourages students to contribute to the project, which makes it more dynamic and inclusive, promoting collaboration and diversity in the community.

To further encourage students to contribute, the project allows students to add openings to the platform by making pull requests (PRs) to the project. This feature helps some students get a better understanding of how Git and GitHub work and enables them to make their first contributions.

other than this, I am also thinking about integrating AI features for application assistance and recommending opportunities to students based on their interests and past experiences. With AI, the platform provides personalized recommendations and guidance to students, helping them make informed decisions about the opportunities available to them. The AI features also assist students in finding relevant opportunities based on their experience level, making it easier for them to get started on their career path.
