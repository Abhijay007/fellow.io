We will make it interactive and give students the option to add openings, once students add an opening we will review that and make sure that opportunity is worth applying to or not, and if it is we will add it to the platform, using this platform students will get an idea about the application process of the particular program and also about the timeline and requirements of the program. We will also be thinking about running podcasts around it and in that podcast, we will talk to past mentees and students associated with that particular program.

### Introduction:

The higher education landscape is constantly evolving, and with it, opportunities are available to students. While traditional paths such as internships and job placements remain popular, newer options such as mentorship programs, fellowships, and boot camps are gaining traction as well. These opportunities can provide valuable experiences and skills that can help students stand out in the job market, but they can be difficult to find and access. That's where Fellowship.io comes in.

Fellowship.io is a platform designed to connect college students with open opportunities in various fields. Our goal is to provide a one-stop solution for students to find and apply to mentorship, fellowship, internship, and boot camp programs that align with their interests and career goals. We believe that by bringing all of these opportunities together on a single platform, we can help students make the most of their college years and set themselves up for success after graduation.

**Problem**:

One of the main challenges that college students face is the lack of knowledge and awareness about the various open opportunities that exist. This can lead to missed opportunities, particularly for students who are not proactive in seeking out these types of programs. In addition, the application process for many of these opportunities can be time-consuming and confusing, making it difficult for students to know where to start.

**Solution**:

Fellowship.io aims to solve these problems by providing a central platform where students can find and apply to a wide range of open opportunities. The platform will include a mailing list feature that will allow students to receive notifications when particular programs begin accepting applications, ensuring that they don't miss out on any opportunities. In addition, the platform will feature a mentor profile section, which will allow students to find mentors who are well-suited to their interests and career goals.

**Motivation**:

One of the main reasons for building Fellowship.io is to help college students overcome the common challenge of missing out on valuable opportunities due to a lack of knowledge and awareness about the different openings available. Many students are unaware of the various programs and opportunities that exist, and as a result, they miss out on opportunities that could help them grow and develop their skills. Fellowship.io aims to address this problem by providing students with a comprehensive and easily accessible platform where they can discover and explore a wide range of opportunities.

### *Features*:

- **Opportunity Filtering**: Fellowship.io allows students to filter opportunities by tech, interest, and program type to find the ones that best fit their needs. This helps students avoid the time-consuming process of sifting through unrelated or irrelevant opportunities.
- **Mailing List**: We understand that students can be busy and that it can be easy to miss out on opportunities if you're not looking for them. That's why we offer a mailing list feature that sends notifications to students when programs start accepting applications. This helps students stay up to date and apply on time.
- **Mentors Profiles**: One of the key benefits of mentorship programs is the opportunity to learn from experienced professionals in your field. Fellowship.io offers profiles of mentors, so students can get a sense of who they will be working with and whether they would be a good fit.
- **Experiences Section**: In addition to profiles, we also have an experiences section where students can read about the experiences of past mentees and students who have participated in programs. This can provide valuable insights and help students make informed decisions about which opportunities to pursue.
- **Interactive Platform**: Fellowship.io is more than just a directory of opportunities. We also encourage students to add openings that they come across and our team reviews and approves these submissions to ensure that they are worth applying to. This helps make the platform a community-driven resource for finding opportunities.
- **Podcasts**: In addition to our platform, we also plan to offer podcasts featuring interviews with past mentees and students who have participated in programs. These podcasts will provide valuable insights and perspectives on what it's like to be a part of these opportunities.

### Vision:

Fellowship.io is a platform designed to help college students find and apply to mentorship, fellowship, internship, and boot camp programs. By bringing all of these opportunities together on a single platform, we hope to make it easier for students to find the right fit and make the most of their college years. With features such as filtering, a mailing list, mentor profiles, an experiences section, and podcasts, we believe that Fellowship.io can be a valuable resource for students looking to take their careers to the next level.
